## Presenter App for Android [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FelixWohlfrom/Presenter-Client-Android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FelixWohlfrom/Presenter-Client-Android)

This app can be used to remote control a presentation e.g. on your notebook.
It requires a server software running on the machine that is controlled.

A sample server can be found [here](https://github.com/FelixWohlfrom/Presenter-Server).

The app is a default android app, running on devices with minimum api level 22.
The connection is established via bluetooth, but wifi support is already planned.
